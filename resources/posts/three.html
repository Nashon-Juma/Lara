As the city bustled with life, a cacophony of sounds filled the air – the
honking of car horns, the chatter of pedestrians, and the distant rumble of
trains passing by. Skyscrapers towered overhead, their glass facades reflecting
the bustling activity below. Neon lights illuminated the streets, casting vibrant
colors onto the pavement. Amidst the chaos, a street musician played a soulful melody
on his guitar, his music cutting through the noise and capturing the attention of
passersby. It was a city alive with energy and vitality, where every street corner
 held a story waiting to be discovered. /n
 A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
